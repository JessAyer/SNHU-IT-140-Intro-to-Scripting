# Text-Base-Game

This text-base game written in Python is my first coding project for SNHU. The object of the text-based game is to navigate the game game enviorment and collect all of the treasures without running into the bad guy. The game is won when all of the treasures are collected. It is lost if the user runs into the bad guy before collecting all of the treasures. 

You can find the psuedocode and flow chart in the design documentation. 

This game was created for SNHU's It-140: Intro to Scription course.
